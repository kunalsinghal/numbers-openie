Numbers can be present in following forms:


1. Adjectives:
   Eg. 8 year old girl was ...
   Eg. A 1994 study showed ...  
   -- we will solve a general problem of extracting adjective features from phrases like "US born presedent" -- 

2. Adverbs:
   Eg. Captain Crook tried to set his foot on the island thrice
   -- not too difficult I guess --
   -- dependency parser will take good care of this --
   
3. One of the:
   Eg. This is one of the best songs I have heard in my lifetime.
   -- nothing to be changed here, just don't mess it up --

4. Percentage:
   Eg. About 5% of people are ...
   -- is this same as 1. ? -- 

5. "one" as a determiner
   Eg. Sprint temperatures vary a lot from one week to another.
   -- no number extraction here --

6. after noun adjectives
   Eg. In world war 2, ...


7. Cardinal number
   Eg. 15 people died in JK floods. 


How should the final thing look like? How to sneak in the new extractions?

Consider the following:

Between August 26 and September 5, the U.S. lost about 15 aircraft while the Japanese lost approximately 19 aircraft.
0.97 (the U.S.; lost; about 15 aircraft; while the Japanese lost approximately 19 aircraft; Between August 26 and September 5)
0.94 (the Japanese; lost; approximately 19 aircraft)

How to make any additions to a sentence like this?

Possible list of tags for numbers. 

CDJ: adjective
CDR: adverb
CDT: time
CDN: noun  -- Aluminium with atomic number 13 is ....
CD: actually denotes cardinality of a set (of noun)


Getting the traing data
----------------------------------------

CDT:

Appears mostly as year.
Four digit numbers greater than 1000 and less than 3000 in wikipedia would make a good trainig data.

---------------------------------------

CDR:

1. Rule1: number followed by "times" or "thrice" or "twice" or "once"
2. Extract the verb associated with the adverb and then find all the sentences with the same verb and exact same numeral.
   Label that numeral in all those sentences as CDR.

Though rule1 should be enough but still just to verify lets step 2.

----------------------------------------

CDN:

If the number is the last element of a noun phrase.
Eg. Aluminium with ---atomic number 13--- is a metal.

We can again bootstrap using this to get more sentence structures. How? Look for senteces which contains the concerned numeral along with the rest of the words in the noun phrase. The numeral in these senteces ought to be CDN.

CD and CDJ are a bit difficult as they both appear when a number is follwed by a noun. However for CDJ we have the number to be start of an adjetive phrase but we do not have an adjective phrase chunker do we? Possible list of tags for numbers. 

CDJ: adjective
CDR: adverb
CDT: time
CDN: noun  -- Aluminium with atomic number 13 is ....
CD: denotes cardinality of a set (of noun) --eg-- 50 people are enrolled in NLP course. 


Getting the training data

CDT:

Appears mostly as year.
Four digit numbers greater than 1000 and less than 3000 in wikipedia could make a good training data covering most of the syntactic diversity of CDT. 

---------------------------------------

CDR:

1. Rule: number followed by "times" or "-ce" like "thrice" or "twice" or "once"
2. Extract the verb associated with the adverb and then find all the sentences with the same verb and exact same numeral.
   Label that numeral in all those sentences as CDR.
